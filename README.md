Facial Expression Recognition System
A comprehensive facial expression recognition system that detects and classifies facial expressions in real-time using TensorFlow and OpenCV.
Features

Real-time facial expression recognition from webcam or image files
Seven emotion categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
Interactive GUI with TkInter for easy navigation and visualization
Complete training pipeline for custom model development
Evaluation tools for model performance assessment

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV 4.x
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
TkInter (for the GUI)

Setup

Clone this repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-expression-recognition.git
cd facial-expression-recognition

Install the required packages:

bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset and train a model (see the Complete Guide), or download a pre-trained model.

Quick Start

Run the main application:

bashpython facial_expression_app.py

Select your input source (webcam or image file)
Click "Start Detection" to begin recognizing facial expressions

Training Your Own Model
Follow the steps in the Complete Guide to train your own model using the FER2013 dataset:

Download the dataset:

bashpython download_fer2013.py --output_dir data

Train the model:

bashpython train_fer_model.py --data_path data/fer2013.csv --output_dir model_output

Evaluate the model:

bashpython model_evaluation.py --model_path model_output/fer_model.h5 --data_path data/fer2013.csv

Use your trained model with the application by placing the fer_model.h5 file in the same directory as the application.

Model Architecture
The default model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with:

Multiple convolutional layers with batch normalization
MaxPooling and Dropout for regularization
Dense layers for final classification
Input shape: 48x48x1 (grayscale face images)
Output: 7 emotion categories

Performance
The model typically achieves:

65-70% accuracy on the FER2013 test set
Real-time performance on modern hardware (CPU)
More accurate for some emotions (Happy, Neutral) than others (Disgust, Fear)
